# Security Measures: 
## A Cost-Benefit Analysis and Motivation for Implementation
In this document, we will review the warnings generated by the Slither tool and discuss the motivation behind them. We will also discuss why these warnings have not been modified. By examining the potential impact of these warnings, we will provide an overview of our decision-making process and the considerations that went into it.

These warnings refer to [this](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#reentrancy-vulnerabilities-3) exact type of attack. The [JTP](./contracts/JTP.sol) contract, being written by us and being callback-free, we are sure that it will not create inconsistencies in event generation.

## Different versions of Solidity are used
We are using two differents solidity version, the 0.8.0 (openzeppelin) and 0.8.16 for our contracts, which is the latest and most secure for deployment according to [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#incorrect-versions-of-solidity). Keeping the compiler at version 0.8.0 means having false positive warnings when compiling. 

## Others
Some warnings appear in the contract [FanToArtistStaking](./contracts/FanToArtistStaking.sol)  which is being developed
The remaining ones comes from the @openzeppelin module which can be excluded running slither with this flag `--filter-paths "/TP/node_modules/@openzeppelin/"`
